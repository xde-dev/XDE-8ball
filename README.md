# XDE-8Ball (v1.0) 🎱

Created by xde-dev | 2026

  Overview
XDE-8Ball is a terminal-based decision tool designed for reliability and ease of use. It demonstrates the use of Python's `random` module for weighted outcomes and the `time` module to enhance user experience through simulated "thinking" delays.

Key Features:
* Classic Mode: 20 original 8-ball responses.
  *Custom Mode: Allows users to input 8 unique possibilities for personalized decision-making.
* UX-Focused: Integrated 2-second delay to simulate "consulting the void," creating a more engaging feel.
* Legal Compliance:*Includes built-in disclaimers to notify users that outcomes are random and intended for entertainment only.

 🛠️ Technical Logic
This project focuses on Control Flow and Conditional Logic:
- Branching: Uses `if/elif/else` structures to ensure clean command handling without logic overlap.
- Input Handling: Validates user commands and provides a graceful "Quit" option.
- standalone Compatibility Structured to be compiled into a single `.exe` using PyInstaller.
